Easy_cabsflex.py is a script designed to facilitate the use of the CABSflex package:
https://bitbucket.org/lcbio/cabsflex/src/master/. CABSflex is a tool for flexible
protein docking, i.e. to search for the best energy of the protein-ligand complex, at
slight movements of the protein and ligand side chains. My script allows
invoke multiple simulations and generate a report to help user choose the best model.
